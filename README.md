# Spark Funds Assignment (EDA)

## Project Brief
You work for Spark Funds, an asset management company. Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.

Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:
- It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
- It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in

## Company's desired strategy
Spark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are investing. This pattern is often observed among early stage startup investors

## Company's business objectives
The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.

## Goals of performing EDA
- Investment type analysis: Comparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc. so that Spark Funds can choose the type that is best suited for their strategy.
- Country analysis: Identifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. These will be Spark Fundsâ€™ favourites as well.
- Sector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors.
